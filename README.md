# PROJECT MJOLNIR

Run the file "main.py". You are going to need "pygame" and "numpy" for this LiDAR simulation. 
In terminal, do "conda install numpy" and "pip install pygame". I recommend creating a separate environment from base in conda, and then installing these packages into that new environment.
